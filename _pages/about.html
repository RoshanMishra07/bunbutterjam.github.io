    Hi, I'm Swapnesh, I design games, playful interactions and do design research. I occasionally also <a href="writing.html" target="_blank"></a>write</a> about things I read, observe and some unpopular opinions on games, play, design, art, and technology. <a href="writing.html" target="_blank">Writing</a> helps me put my thoughts together, reflect and clear the chaos <i style="font-size: smaller;">(or does it?)</i>.<br><br>
    
    
    My current interest is in exploring games as a form of non-verbal communication, to express, explore and learn complex ideas in an abstract and creative ways. I support coexistence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism" target="_blank">absurdism</a> and <a href="https://www.ludozofi.com/home/library/grasshopper/" target="_blank">the grasshopper</a>.<br><br>

    Recently, I've started to learn creative coding, I upload some of my hand drawn and generative sketches on a <a href="https://bunbutterjam.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">tumblr blog</a>. <br><br><br>
