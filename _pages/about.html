    Hi, I'm Swapnesh, I design games, interactions and do design research. I occasionally also <a href=""></a> <a href="writing.html" target="_blank">write</a> about things I read, observe and some unpopular opinions on games, play, design, art, and technology. Writing helps me put my thoughts together, reflect and clear the chaos <i style="font-size: smaller;">(or does it?)</i>.<br><br>
    
    I mostly work independent on projects with studios, clients and in collaboration with other designers, artists, researchers, and developers. My current interest is in exploring games as a form of non-verbal communication, to express, explore and learn complex ideas in an abstract and creative ways. <br><br>
