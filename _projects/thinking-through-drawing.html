    Taking drawing as a medium, this research project illustrates the influence of schooling and significance of socio-cultural context on children's thinking, imagination and creative expression.

The process of drawing slows down the act of seeing that helps in developing a keen observation, imagination and makes as more sensitive towards our own thoughts, and feelings, and also to our surroundings. Children naturally express their physical actions, hopes, ideas, desires, worries and anxieties in their drawings. It depicts their actual experience of reality with a connection to their past and the desired future. 

Starting from early stages of mark making and scribbling to real life drawing and abstraction, different socio-cultural, religious and educational factors influence the drawings we make. This project tries to understand these influence from an education point of view, and how the expression changes as we go higher in education.

The research has been conducted with students of different classes from 2<sup>nd</sup> till 12<sup>th</sup>, of different socio-economical, cultural and religious background at different schools in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
