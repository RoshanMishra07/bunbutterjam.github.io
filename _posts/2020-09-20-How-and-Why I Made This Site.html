    So, I made a new site and shifted from my previous bootstrappy, almost non-functional, and non-inviting one. I never quite liked it and been thinking of making a new one. After my convocation, I came back home in March, and just a few days later the lockdown was announced, and we were all forced to quarantine for an indefinite period of time. The situation is getting worst but the best I could do was to stay home. Suddenly last month I got reminded of updating my site, I thought of using the time to learn new things and delve a bit deeper into web development. I was planning to re-design the site from scratch and making something very basic like one of those <a href="https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html">Stallman</a> style web pages with just hyperlinks with no javascript or even CSS. But the designer inside me couldn't resist styling, and I thought maybe I would go for that sort of aesthetic when I will be his age, but for now, let's have little fun and explore something new. <br><br>

    I started exploring <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and with a few tweaks made a basic structure that ended up to this site. I was already using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for my old website, so Jekyll was a good go with easy deployment and pushing updates. It's built for blog, is flexible, and more importantly open source. A perfect combination I was looking for. I'm using <a href="https://github.com/ronv/sidey">sidey</a> for the blog, <a href="https://pawelgrzybek.github.io/siema/">siema</a> for the slider, and <a href="https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugin/lightbox">lightbox</a> for lightbox. <br><br>
    
    Here, I plan to write about things I'm working on, thinking of, and intermittently my personal experiences <i class="i">(self talk)</i> in the form of text and visuals, mostly text. I'm also trying to make this a documentation space for work <i class="i">(basically portfolio)</i> and thoughts that I don't want to fade away from my memory or computer's memory, so that I can look back and feel stupid/nostalgic about it in the future <i class="i">(assuming I the web will be there)</i>. I'm not a very social <i class="i">(or social media)</i> person, and I wanted to have my own small space on the crowded web where I can express without pressure and can have control over the content. There are more things that I keep telling myself to justify my actions, but I guess, for now, this much seems convincing. Let's see how it goes. :) <br><br>
