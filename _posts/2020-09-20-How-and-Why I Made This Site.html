    So, I made a new site and shifted from . I never quite liked it and been thinking of making a new one. After my convocation, I came back home in March, and just a few days later the lockdown was announced, and we were all forced to quarantine for an indefinite period of time. The situation outside since then has been degrading everyday and now its getting even worst so the best I could do probably was to stay home. I've been learning new things everyday since last six month and last month I thought of using the time to delve into web development to upgrade from my previous bootstrappy, barely functional, and non-inviting webpage to a new, simple, lightweight and blog aware site. I was planning to make it from scratch, the engineer in me was leaning towards function only, <a href="https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html">Stallman</a> style web pages with just hyperlinks with no javascript or even CSS, but the designer inside me couldn't resist styling, and I thought maybe I would go for that sort of aesthetic when I will be his age, but for now, let's have little fun and explore something new while also keeping it simple. <br><br>

    I started exploring <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and soon with a few tweaks I had a basic structure that ended up to this site. I was already using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for my old static websites, so Jekyll was a good go with easy deployment and pushing updates. It's built for blog, is flexible, and more importantly open source. A perfect combination I was looking for. I'm using <a href="https://github.com/ronv/sidey">sidey</a> for the blog, <a href="https://pawelgrzybek.github.io/siema/">siema</a> for the slider, and <a href="https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugin/lightbox">lightbox</a> for lightbox. <br><br>
    
    Here, I plan to post about things I'm working on, thinking of, and intermittently my personal experiences <i class="i">(self talk)</i> in the form of text and visuals, mostly text. I'm also trying to make this a documentation space for work <i class="i">(basically portfolio)</i> and thoughts that I don't want to fade away from my memory or computer's memory but eventually they do, to make me look back and feel stupid/nostalgic about how I was in the past.<i class="i">(assuming we both will be alive)</i>. I'm not a very social <i class="i">(or social media)</i> person, and I always wanted to have my own small space on the crowded web where I can express without pressure and can have control over the content I post. I hope to be regular and make at least one post a month or more depend on what is happing in that month. There are more things that I keep telling myself to justify my actions, but I guess, for now, this much seems convincing. Let's see how it goes. :) <br><br>
