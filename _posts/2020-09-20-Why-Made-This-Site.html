title: Why I made this site?

<p>

    So, I made a new site and shifted from my previous bootstrappy, almost non-functional, and non-inviting one. I never quite liked it and been thinking of making a new one. After my convocation, I came back home in March, and just a few days later the lockdown was announced, and we were all forced to quarantine for an indefinite time. I was happy that I could stay home and can make an excuse to not go out and just be lazy for some time and do nothing 'productive'. The situation was getting worst but the best I could do was to stay home. I thought of using the time to learn new things and delve a bit deeper into web development. I wanted to re-design the site from scratch and initially was thinking of making something very basic like one of those <a href="https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html">Stallman</a> style web pages with just hyperlinks with no javascript or even CSS. But then I thought maybe I would go for that sort of aesthetic when I will be his age, but for now, let's have little fun and explore something new. <br><br>

    I wanted to keep it open-source, blog-aware, and lightweight. I started exploring <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and with a few tweaks made a basic structure that ended up to this site. I was already using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for my old website, so Jekyll was a good go with easy deployment and update. It's built for blog, is flexible, and more importantly open source. A perfect combination I was looking for. I'm using <a href="https://github.com/ronv/sidey">sidey</a> for the blog, <a href="https://pawelgrzybek.github.io/siema/">siema</a> for the slider, and <a href="https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugin/lightbox">lightbox</a> for lightbox. <br><br>
    
    Here, I will be writing about things I'm working on, thinking of, and intermittently my personal experiences <i class="i">(self talk)</i> in the form of text and visuals, mostly text. I'm also trying to make this a documentation space for work <i class="i">(basically portfolio)</i> and thoughts that I don't want to fade away from my memory or computer's memory, so that I can look back and feel stupid/nostalgic about it in the future <i class="i">(assuming the web will be there)</i>. I'm not a very social <i class="i">(or social media)</i> person, and I wanted to have my own small space on the crowded web where I can express without pressure and can have control over the content. There are more things that I keep telling myself to justify my actions, but I guess, for now, this much seems convincing. Let's see how it goes. :) <br><br>
